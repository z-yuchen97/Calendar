+ Users can share their calendar with additional users.   
+ Users can create group events that display on multiple users calendars.  
+ If you click the event, you will find the information of that event show in the box of "New event", so it is easy for you to modify some parts of that event. Remember to click "modify" not "add" if you want to modify an event.  
+ If tou want to create a group event to many people, please follow the rules:user1;user2;user3  
you do not need to add your own name into the input box, because the group event you create would automatically appear on your calendar.
